# discord-cli

discord-cli is a straightforward Discord bot built using the Discord.js v14 library.

## Features

- Deploy commands
- View servers

## Installation

discord-cli requires [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) v16.9+ to run.

Just a heads up, to run this bad boy, you'll need to have pnpm installed. Once you've got that taken care of, go ahead and clone this repo and navigate to the project directory in your terminal.

To install all the dependencies, simply run:

```sh
pnpm install
```

And to start up the application, just type:

```sh
pnpm start
```
Easy!
